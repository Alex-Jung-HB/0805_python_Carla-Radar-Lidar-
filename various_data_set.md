- **Environment**: Indoor test facility or closed test track
- **Purpose**: Algorithm validation and baseline testing

#### What You'd Expect to See
```
✅ Simple geometric objects (boxes, cylinders, cones)
✅ Controlled lighting conditions
✅ No weather interference
✅ Predictable, static obstacles
✅ Perfect sensor synchronization
```

#### Real-World Examples
- **Waymo**: Desert testing facility with artificial obstacles

### 🌲 Natural Scene - Real-World Outdoor Environment

#### Characteristics
- **Point Count**: 1,499 lidar, ~0 radar (sensor failure or sparse detections)
- **Environment**: Real roads, countryside, suburban areas
- **Purpose**: Real-world algorithm performance testing

#### What You'd Expect to See
```
🌿 Trees, vegetation, natural terrain
🌦️ Weather effects (rain, shadows)
🦌 Animals, pedestrians, varied obstacles
📡 Radar interference from foliage
🛣️ Irregular road boundaries
📊 Organic, unpredictable point distributions
```

#### Why Radar Data is Missing
- **Dense foliage**: Trees/vegetation block radar signals
- **Rural environment**: Few large metallic objects to detect
- **Sensor interference**: Natural materials don't reflect radar well
- **Data collection issue**: Possible sensor malfunction

```
🏙️ Buildings, road signs, guardrails
🚦 Traffic lights, lane markings
🏗️ Dense point clouds from architectural structures
📐 Geometric, man-made patterns
🚗 Infrastructure-focused (static objects)
```

#### Why Only 2 Radar Detections
- **Highway scenario**: Few vehicles in immediate vicinity
- **Urban canyon**: Buildings block distant radar returns
- **Infrastructure focus**: Stationary objects don't generate radar velocity signatures

## 🤔 Why These Differences Matter

### Algorithm Development Strategy

1. **Start with Lab**: Validate basic algorithms

3. **Deploy in Structured**: Navigate complex urban environments

### Sensor Fusion Implications

- **Lab**: Can rely on both lidar + radar equally
- **Natural**: Must handle radar sensor failures gracefully
- **Structured**: Lidar-dominant with minimal radar support

### Processing Pipeline Adjustments

```python
if environment == "lab":
    # Use both sensors equally
    trust_radar = True
    
elif environment == "natural": 
    # Lidar-only mode
    trust_radar = False
    
elif environment == "structured":
    # Lidar primary, radar secondary
    trust_radar = radar_detections > 0
```
